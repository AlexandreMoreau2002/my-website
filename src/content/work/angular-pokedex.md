### Introduction

As a personal project, I embarked on creating my first Angular project, the Angular Pokedex. This endeavor provided me with invaluable experience in Angular, a powerful front-end framework.

### Functionality and Features I learned

Throughout the development process, I delved into various aspects of Angular, including:

* Components: Utilizing Angular's component-based architecture to create modular and reusable UI elements.
* Templates: Employing Angular's template syntax to dynamically generate HTML based on data and logic.
* Directives: Exploring directives to manipulate the DOM, apply styles, and control the behavior of components.
* Pipes: Leveraging pipes to transform data within templates for presentation purposes.
* Routes: Implementing routing to enable navigation between different views within the application.
* Modules: Organizing the application into cohesive modules to encapsulate functionality.
* Services: Utilizing services to share data and functionality across components.
* Forms: Implementing Angular's powerful form handling capabilities for user input validation and management.
* Reactive Programming: Embracing reactive programming principles with RxJS to handle asynchronous data streams.
* HTTP Requests: Integrating HTTP requests to fetch data from external APIs and services.
  
This project served as an excellent introduction to Angular, allowing me to grasp the fundamental concepts and workflows of this versatile front-end framework. Through hands-on experience and experimentation, I gained a deeper understanding of Angular's core principles and best practices.

### Stack

For the development of this project, I utilized HTML, CSS, TypeScript, and Materialize framework for styling and UI components. Additionally, Firebase was chosen as the hosting platform for seamless deployment and hosting of the Angular Pokedex application.
