## Capitalize

## Introduction

As a personal project, I created a web application that allows users to convert text to lowercase or uppercase and copy the result to the clipboard. This project provided me with valuable experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, enhancing my skills in front-end web development.

## Functionality and Features

Throughout the development process, I explored various web development concepts, including:

* **HTML and CSS**: Structuring and styling the web page to create a user-friendly interface.
* **JavaScript**: Implementing functionality to convert text and handle clipboard operations.
* **DOM Manipulation**: Using JavaScript to dynamically update the content of the web page based on user input.
* **Event Handling**: Managing user interactions such as button clicks.
* **Notifications**: Displaying notifications to inform users about successful or failed actions.
* **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the application is usable across different devices and screen sizes.

## Deployment and CI/CD

To streamline the deployment process and ensure that the application can be easily updated with new features or bug fixes, I implemented Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) using GitHub Actions. This setup automatically deploys updates to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to the main branch, ensuring that the latest version of the application is always available to users.

## Stack

For the development of this project, I utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, GitHub Pages was chosen as the hosting platform for seamless deployment and hosting of the application.

## Conclusion

This project served as an excellent introduction to front-end web development, allowing me to grasp the fundamental concepts and workflows of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Through hands-on experience and experimentation, I gained a deeper understanding of web development principles and best practices, as well as how to implement CI/CD pipelines to automate deployment.
