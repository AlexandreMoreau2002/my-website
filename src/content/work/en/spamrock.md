### Introduction

As a fullstack developer at **Thomyris**, I'm contributing to the development of **Spamrock**, a SaaS platform for managing email servers aimed at businesses. The project is built around a **multi-tenant architecture** (multi-database) and includes advanced **anti-spam** and **anti-virus** filtering capabilities. The interface is fully responsive and compatible across all modern browsers.

### Tech Stack

The project relies on the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: Vue.js & Nuxt 3  
- **Backend**: Laravel, MySQL  
- **Testing**: Vitest, PhpUnit, Cypress  
- **CI/CD**: GitLab, Docker  
- **Tools**: Jira, GitLab, Microsoft Suite  

### Features & Contributions

- Built responsive user interfaces with Nuxt 3  
- Designed, tested, and optimized secure REST APIs  
- Integrated unit, automated, and end-to-end tests (Vitest, Cypress)  
- Improved CI/CD pipelines (GitLab) in collaboration with DevOps engineers  
- Actively involved in **Agile workflows**: daily standups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives  
- Daily use of **GitLab** for project tracking and code reviews  
- Ongoing tech watch on Vue.js, Laravel, and DevOps best practices  
- Developed the frontend of an **internal monitoring tool** in React + GraphQL to track real-time client onboarding, infrastructure status, KPIs, and support tickets  
- Implemented internationalization using i18n to support a multilingual interface (FR/EN/ES/DE)  
- Integrated email functionality to manage notifications, alerts, and user communications  

### Takeaways

This project has helped me strengthen my **fullstack development** skills, evolve in a demanding professional environment, and collaborate effectively with a growing technical team.
