### Introduction

As a passionate developer, it was essential for me to have my own website. My goal was clear: present my projects in a professional and efficient manner, while launching the site quickly.

### Stack

For its development, I chose to turn to Astro technology for several fundamental reasons. First of all, Astro is based on the principle of Markdown files, which offers great flexibility in content management. Using Markdown, I can easily update and organize my projects, experiences and skills in a clear and structured way, without having to deal with complex programming languages.

Additionally, Astro is a static content-oriented technology, which means my portfolio benefits from fast loading speed, strong security, and excellent SEO performance. By avoiding databases and dynamic queries, my site is lighter, more reliable and easier to host, ensuring an optimal user experience for all visitors.

By choosing to use this technology for the creation of my portfolio, I am focusing on efficiency, simplicity and robustness. It allows me to highlight my achievements in a professional and engaging manner, while providing a smooth and intuitive navigation experience to my visitors.

On the tech side, I used the fundamentals of web development using HTML, CSS and TypeScript to ensure the structure, style and interactivity of my portfolio. These well-established languages provide a solid foundation for creating a smooth and engaging user experience.

Additionally, I integrated the use of Markdown for managing static content files. This proved to be a wise choice because Markdown offers a simple and intuitive syntax for writing content, making it easy to create and update pages without having to deal with complex HTML code.

For hosting, I opted for Firebase for its free, easy to use and efficient solution. Using their platform, I was able to upload my portfolio quickly and hassle-free, while enjoying reliable performance and seamless integration with my favorite development tools.
