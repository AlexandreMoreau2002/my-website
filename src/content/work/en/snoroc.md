### Introduction

As part of my final internship for the Web and Mobile Web Developer Professional Certificate, I designed and delivered a dynamic showcase website for the music band **Snoroc**. The project is now live at [snoroc.fr](https://snoroc.fr/), turning months of work into a production-ready product.

### Goals and context

Since my internship supervisor was a member of the band, my mission was to create a modern web platform to showcase their music, albums, and general information for fans. The interface had to be responsive, intuitive, and easy to maintain.

### Tech stack

This project was built using the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML5, CSS3 with Sass
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Project management & design**: Git for version control, Notion for task tracking, prototypes in Figma
- **Hosting & CI/CD**: Automated GitHub Actions workflows deploying to OVHcloud hosting

### Implemented features

- Designed interactive prototypes with Figma to define the UI and user flows
- Built a modular frontend using React.js
- Developed a REST API in Node.js with Express to manage dynamic content (albums, songs, etc.)
- Integrated frontend and backend for consistent and reliable communication
- Set up a MySQL relational database
- Used Notion to organize tasks, priorities, and project milestones
- Automated the deployment pipeline (tests, build, release) through GitHub Actions to OVHcloud

### Takeaways

Going all the way to a live deployment on OVHcloud helped me experience each step of a product lifecycle: design, development, testing, CI/CD, and release management. It strengthened my fullstack skills, my user-focused approach, and my ability to industrialize delivery.
