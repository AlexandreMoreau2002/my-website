### Introduction

As part of my final internship for the Web and Mobile Web Developer Professional Certificate, I had the opportunity to design and build a dynamic showcase website for the music band **Snoroc**. Although the project couldn’t be completed within the given time, it offered a rich learning experience in fullstack development and project organization.

### Goals and context

Since my internship supervisor was a member of the band, my mission was to create a modern web platform to showcase their music, albums, and general information for fans. The interface had to be responsive, intuitive, and easy to maintain.

### Tech stack

This project was built using the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML5, CSS3 with Sass
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Project management tools**: Git for version control, Notion for task tracking
- **Design & Prototyping**: Figma

### Implemented features

- Designed interactive prototypes with Figma to define the UI and user flows
- Built a modular frontend using React.js
- Developed a REST API in Node.js with Express to manage dynamic content (albums, songs, etc.)
- Integrated frontend and backend for consistent and reliable communication
- Set up a MySQL relational database
- Used Notion to organize tasks, priorities, and project milestones

### Takeaways

Despite not reaching full delivery within the internship timeframe, this project was a valuable experience. It strengthened my fullstack skills, introduced me to user-centered design, and highlighted the importance of planning and task management in real-world development.
